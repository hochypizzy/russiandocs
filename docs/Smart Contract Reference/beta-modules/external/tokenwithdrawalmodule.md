Module for transferring ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens for IP Accounts.

*SECURITY RISK: An IPAccount can delegate to a frontend contract (not a registered module) to transfer tokens\
on behalf of the IPAccount via the Token Management Module. This frontend contract can transfer any tokens that are\
approved by the IPAccount for the Token Management Module. In other words, there's no mechanism for this module to\
granularly control which token a caller (approved contract in this case) can transfer.*

```solidity
string name
```
