constructor(address royaltyPolicyLAP) public
```

### claim

```solidity
function claim(address ipId, address claimerIpId, address[] ancestors, uint32[] ancestorsRoyalties, bool withdrawETH, contract ERC20[] tokens) external
```

Claims all available royalty nfts and accrued royalties for an ancestor of a given ipId
