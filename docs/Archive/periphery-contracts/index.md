  The Story Protocol Gateway serves as the main entrypoint for simplified IP
  interaction. For most simpler use-cases involving IP registration and
  management, we recommend calling this contract.

The Story Protocol Protocol Gateway ("SPG") is the main periphery contract smart contract developers should interact with if building simpler abstractions on top of the core protocol. It provides simple tooling for IP collection management, IP registration, IP licensing, and access control management. 

The SPG is deployed on Sepolia at: `0x5a12E3F0DAeF58d493fa4c5a462e8cEB7b15cF28`

Listed below are the core functions provided by the SPG, with a detailed explanation of how to craft these inputs to build the programmable IP of your dreams!

* [Default IP Collection](doc:default-ip-collection)
* [Create IP Collection](doc:ip-creation)
* [Register IP](doc:register-ip)
* [Mint And Register IP](doc:mint-and-register-ip)
* [Register Derivative IP](doc:register-derivative-ip)
* [Mint And Register Derivative IP](doc:mint-and-register-derivative-ip)
