The `mintAndRegisterDerivativeIp` function should be used whenever you want to enroll a new IP asset that does not yet exist as an ERC-721, and you want to register it as a derivative of some existing work. This function is most commonly called by users who hold licenses to certain IP and wish to create a remixed variation of one or more works that their IP then gets registered as. For most cases, we recommend that developers choose the [Default IP Collection](doc:default-ip-collection) for the NFT representation of the derivative IP.

**Function Interface**:

```
    /// @notice Mints and registers a Story Protocol NFT into the protocol as an IP asset derivative.
    /// @param licenseIds The licenses to incorporate for the new IP.
    /// @param royaltyContext The bytes-encoded context for royalty policy to process.
    /// @param tokenContract The address of the NFT bound to the root-level IP.
    /// @param tokenMetadata Token metadata in bytes to include for NFT minting.
    /// @param ipMetadata Metadata related to IP attribution.
    /// @return tokenId The identifier of the minted NFT.
    /// @return ipId The address identifier of the newly registered IP asset.
    function mintAndRegisterDerivativeIpWithSig(
        uint256[] calldata licenseIds,
        bytes calldata royaltyContext,
        address tokenContract,
        bytes calldata tokenMetadata,
        Metadata.IPMetadata calldata ipMetadata,
        SPG.Signature calldata signature
    ) external returns (uint256 tokenId, address ipId);

```

**Applicable structs** 

```
    /// @notice Describes a custom string key-value pair attribute.
    struct Attribute {
        string key;
        string value;
    }

    /// @notice Attributes related to IP metadata.
    struct IPMetadata {
        string name;
        bytes32 hash;
        string url;
        Attribute[] customMetadata;
    }
    /// @notice Signature of ERC712.
    struct Signature {
        // The address of the signer.
        address signer;
        // The time at which the signature expires.
        uint256 deadline;
        // The signature itself.
        bytes signature;
    }
```

## Detailed Overview

The `mintAndRegisterIp` function takes eight parameters

**`uint256[] calldata licenseIds`**

The `licenseIds` array represents a list of licenses identifiers that the deriving IP originates from. To get a `licenseId`, a user must create a new license out of an existing IP with a policy attached to it. For instructions on how to do so, please. see the [Licensing (Module)](doc:licensing-1) section.

**`bytes royaltyContext`**

In Story Protocol, IPs that are configured with a royalty policy require all derivative IP assets to specify a royalty context, which is an abi-encoding of all the relevant settings that dictate how royalty should work. For more information, on the details of this, please see the [Royalty (Module)](doc:royalty-module) section.

**`address tokenContract`**

The `tokenContract` identifies the address of the Story Protocol ERC-721 that will be minted to represent your IP. This parameter may either be the [Default IP Collection](doc:default-ip-collection) address, or a custom IP collection created using [Create IP Collection](doc:ip-creation). Note that you must be authorized by the configured collection for the mint to succeed in the first place, which will always be the case for the [Default IP Collection](doc:default-ip-collection) since it is publicly available to all.

**`bytes calldata tokenMetadata`**

The `tokenMetadata` is used to specify any metadata that you would like to pass to the NFT collection for representing your newly minted IP. For the [Default IP Collection](doc:default-ip-collection) type, this field is required to be an abi-encoding of the following struct:

```
    /// @notice Attributes related to token-specific ERC-721 metadata.
    struct TokenData {
        string name;            // Name to provide the IP within the NFT collection.
        string description;     // Description to provide to the IP within the NFT collection.
        string externalUrl;     // An external link to associate with the IP within the NFT collection.
        string image;           // An image, such as an IPFS link, used to visually depict the IP within the NFT collection.
        Attribute[] attributes; // A set of additional custom string key-value pairs to link with the IP within the NFT collection.
    }

```

Note that this is different from all the below fields, in that it is metadata strictly tied to the IP within the NFT collection, as opposed to metadata tied to the IP asset bound to your IP. To clarify further, the `tokenMetadata` should describe all metadata that does not concern IP per se, such as traditional NFT attributes.

**`IPMetadata ipMetadata`**

The`ipMetadata` refers to the metadata you would like to associate with the IP. It is composed of the following fields:

* **`string name`**
  * The name you would like to assign to the registered IP asset. For simple on-chain NFT assets, this can simply be a concatenation of the collection name and your unique NFT identifier. However, for something more real-world applicable, such as a tokenized T-shirt logo, this can be something a bit more specific, such as "Story Protocol LS Tee Logo".
* **`bytes32 contentHash`**
  * The `contentHash` refers to a unique hash of the IP being registered. How this content hash is generated should be based on the requirements of the type of IP being registered, but for most intents and purposes, a simple SHA-256 checksum can work.
* **`string externalURL`**
  * The `externalURL` refers to an external URL that users may be redirected to when they want to learn more about the IP component of your registered asset. This, for example, may be a link to an IPFS PDF providing contextual information regarding how this IP was created in the first place.
* **`Attribute[] ipMetadata`**
  * The `ipMetadata` refers to additional IP metadata string key-value pairs that you may bind to the IP on registration. For example, this could be an array such as `[{"Copyright Type", "Literary Work"}, {"Literary Type", "Novel"}]`. Using custom IP metadata attribution is what allows extensibility for other types of on-chain IP composition. Note that for `v0.1-beta`, only string attribution is supported.
* **`Signature signature`**
  * The EIP-712 signature enables users to grant permissions to SPG, authorizing it to interact with other modules. This specifically includes the Licensing Module and the Metadata Resolver Module, which are utilized within the function.
  * **`address signer`** the address sign the message
  * **`uint256 deadline`** The time at which the signature expires.
  * **`uint256 signature`** The signature itself

```
				uint deadline = block.timestamp + 1000;
        AccessPermission.Permission[] memory permissionList = new AccessPermission.Permission[](2);
        permissionList[0] = AccessPermission.Permission({
            ipAccount: ipId,
            signer: address(spg),
            to: licensingModuleAddr,
            func: bytes4(0),
            permission: AccessPermission.ALLOW
        });
        permissionList[1] = AccessPermission.Permission({
            ipAccount: ipId,
            signer: address(spg),
            to: ipResolverAddr,
            func: bytes4(0),
            permission: AccessPermission.ALLOW
        });
        bytes32 digest = MessageHashUtils.toTypedDataHash(
            MetaTx.calculateDomainSeparator(ipId),
            MetaTx.getExecuteStructHash(
                MetaTx.Execute({
                    to: accessControllerAddr,
                    value: 0,
                    data: abi.encodeWithSignature(
                        "setBatchPermissions((address,address,address,bytes4,uint8)[])",
                        permissionList
                    ),
                    nonce: 1,
                    deadline: deadline
                })
            )
        );

        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(alicePk, digest);
        bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s, v);
```

### IMPORTANT

In the current version of Story Protocol, `v0.1-beta`, all metadata is assumed to be immutable upon registration. Note that this will likely change in the future.
