For version `v0.1-beta`, Story Protocol makes the assumption that every prospective IP asset MUST first exist as an ERC-721 before it can be registered onto the protocol. For this reason, Story Protocol has a global, publicly mint-able ERC-721 IP collection deployed on every supported chain that it recommends new users to represent their IP on, known as the default ERC721 SP NFT. This IP collection treats every NFT as a completely different entity with entirely customizable metadata, along with native support for IP data attribution once registered into the protocol. As such, for users who do not yet have an NFT to represent the IP they wish to enroll, we highly recommend simply utilizing the default ERC721 SP NFT address, and registering your IP either with the [Mint And Register IP](doc:mint-and-register-ip) or [Mint And Register Derivative IP](doc:mint-and-register-derivative-ip) functions.
